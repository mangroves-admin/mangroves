  copy: "Building on the learning of this past year's pilot fellowship, a second cohort of fellows began to gather in hybrid form in October, this time on the theme of \"growth.\" The culmination of this project will be the Connival on Growth in Rome.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beyond the 2023 Connival on Growth, we will turn our attention to a cultural critique of intelligence and its artificial construction, at a moment of its pervasive deployment. This project will take the form of international workshops, a documentary and collected volume."
