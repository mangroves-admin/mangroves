            <h3>Ameen Ahmed</h3>
            <p>
              Ameen Ahmed is a curator, artist, writer, and researcher from
              Bangalore, India, and Toronto, Canada. His current research
              interests revolve around “magic”, which he describes as the use of
              the rhetoric and methods of religion and myth by political and
              corporate agents of “progress” and “development”. This is part of
              a larger interest in stories and storytelling, whether those
              stories are disseminated through media, or through visual,
              political, or architectural means.

            <h3>Duff Allen</h3>
            <p>
              Duff Allen is a writer living in upstate New York. His work is
              driven by an underlying and indomitable happy despair that regards
              storytelling as the light seen through the keyhole, even if the
              door is quite heavy and bolted shut. He teaches writing at Bard
              College.
