  copy: "Having plumbed \"the common\" against the anthropocentric grain in our inaugural Fellowship, we then stepped into the maze-forest of \"growth\" with these curvatures: the pluriverse, the \"transverse,\" and the \"perverse\" [PURR-verse]. What, you say? While preglobal worldings have projected universes of their own, a scientized neo-empire has imposed <i>its</i> universe on all others under the guise of objective, not just conventional, reality. The pluriverse ensures the continuance of distinct, even resistant, worldings. The partial connections between them permit give-and-take, but the power dynamics also forbid fair play or real delinkage (Mignolo). The transverse is our way to slide between them and take up, not an othering of alien worldings, but an othering of one's own enough to negotiate \"otherly\" realities. Yet even this transversal can reify, detemporalize each common lifing - and underpower - \"co-lifing\" over transoms. Enter the <i>perverse</i>. Instead of reducing to a Deist minimum (Cherbury) for a new universal, we propose a <i>perversal</i> platform where the evolving interactions of the pluriverse and its transversal can also spawn multilaterally translated, sharable commons allowing at once evolving diverging and convergence. Again, we mean this beyond a human focus. With this macromicro differentiality and \"posthumanist\" imaginary, we could now begin to think \"growth\" in its myriad embodiments - even inversions, eversions, reversions..."

  copy: "That staging done, we slid into V Smil's survey of \"growth.\" As a universalist account under scientific scope, it deployed a metron for all material reality: from the cell to megacities under one lens, with patterned vertical climbs: linear, logorithmic, exponential. Rimming scientific consensus, Smil warns of peaks and limits of growth. What of incommensurate ways of describing, living the world? Can a non-lizard do the <i>sentipensar</i> for a lizard? In his monoscoping, Smil owes much to the breathtaking correlations of A von Humboldt across the continents he traversed, but also assumes the All that Humboldt globalized of Hegel's Hellenic universal. Yet can difference in kind be corraled numerically without requalification or translation? Leaving such a platform of \"growth,\" we plied our own translinguistic query. With over two dozen tongues among us, we uncovered various construals of \"growth\": lengthening, enlarging, stretching, opening, greening, unfurling, blowing up... Of the last, we also correlated the Greek <i>physis</i> to R Williams' relook at \"nature,\" derived from that Greek term but denatured by modern science.

  To retake an ampler sense of growth, we turned to the penetrating insights of Laozi, Nagarjuna, and Qohelet, who articulated processes in terms of radical contingency, emergence, metabolic recursion. We saw the latter (with B Lawrence's help) in Ibn Khaldun in dynastic phases where, within each phase of growth, there was also degrowth or attrition, atrophy. The Chinese painting \"Up the River at Qingming\" pictorialized this complex irony: At the peak of prosperity was already decline, decadence - peril. But growth is not only socioeconomic, as we gleaned from the Rhineland (Hildegard), the Potawatomi of North American plains (Kimmerer), and the sex pots of pre-Columbian Moche elites. They were also spiritual, ecological, social - in sum, relational. A Escobar and M Osterweil reminded us (in person) of that, as did mycopunkerie, Kropotkin's (and Wu-Tang Clan's) mutual aid, along with Illich's conviviality - a sort of mutual growth like <i>ubuntu</i>. Others pointed at useless or noxious growth (Marx, Graeber, Bregman). The relationality of growth becomes sobering in considering \"operational land\" (cum air and sea), where the cities subsist on their far-reaching CC2, as did D Richter's critical zone science. Such vantages gave us caveats to thinking through current plights of housing and dwelling, as well as a wide lens from which to approach D da Cunha's protean concept of ubiquitous wetness and A Tamburrino's Carless Rome project, an attempt to transmobilize - thus recondition - Rome."

  copy: "Having thus tinkered with \"growth\" in both theoretic and pragmatic terms, we now find ourselves in a new clearing, a \"nir-vana\" of no forest. We searched in all directions for \"growth,\" and, in pushing through the thicket of its vertiginous vectors reached its point of <i>useless fruition</i>. This mirrors the productive indeterminacy (D Barber) that characterized our earlier toil on \"the common,\" and points a way out of the chokehold of relentless (economic) growth and \"progress.\" Maybe with this release, growth could now be <i>renatured</i> if not rewilded, and be allowed to go its thousand woven ways."
