title: Connival on Growth
copy: "<b>Premise</b>: To release thinking on growth from the double bind of developmental economics and linear thinking by redrilling this dominant tale and conceiving new pathways of \"growth.\"

<br><br>

<b>Players</b>: Discussants, buildings, moderators, clowns, exhibitors, musicians, artists, chefs, MR practitioners, planners, stage hands, ghosts, attendees, dark sky, places and placemakers, Roman pines, shops and topography, media/onlookers
