name: PeriblemVsProblem
copy: "\"Problem solving\" has loitered almost as long as Western thought. From the Problemata of Pseudo-Aristotle and of Plutarch to their Medieval turn into Scholastic <i>quaestiones</i>, to the modern Cartesian legacy of science, technocracy, and computation (algorithms and AI), the \"problem\" has squatted the realm of thought and practice - and outpaced its own usefulness.
  <br><br>

  This problem-solution model feeds on the subject-object distinction prevalent in Indo-European linguistics, but hardened by a broader Western metaphysics of dichotomies, of the exterior/interior, singular/plural, material/intellective, active/passive, individual/collective, etc. Descartes' <i>res cogitans</i> and <i>res extensa</i> codified this binary logic right into problem solving by progressive discretization (a riff on Scholastic <i>clarification</i>), eventually also undergirding modern computing and digital technology no less than genetic and nano-technologies and particle physics.
  <br><br>

  The logic of the problem also drives capitalistic economy, tied as it is to \"problems\" of shortage (or excess) - of supply and demand in labor and material, goods, and services. Each problem can be \"solved\" by requantifying something. What's less evident is that \"solutions\" are often devised as a function of some unstated desire, then the problem retrofitted to ratify it. Thus new markets are found, goods are obsolesced, and the cycle of merchandise geared to fiscal years and quarterly reports. In this sense, problems become not accidental, but embedded, necessitated as a continuous invention. Nowhere is this more transparent than in the academy.
  <br><br>

  The \"problem\" with the \"problem\" is that it presents as a volumetric exteriority, isolated in its clinical scope. But as in the modern pharmacology built on this model, effects are not governed by original desire. There are leaks, side effects, which in turn generate new \"problems\" - hence the proverbial pharmaceutical cocktail, in which drugs don't just work <i>with</i> but also <i>against</i> each other. The best of efforts in problem-solving, say, polio eradication, spawn new challenges to the affected population. The foreignness of vaccines provokes antagonism, the capacitation they offer strains employment, and social hierarchies have to be recalibrated.
  <br><br>

  There is an analogy between classical mechanics and problems in that their utility obtrudes at certain scales but not others. At most the pair can fix a car. In contrast, the apocalypses unfolding before us in ecology, economics and technobiopolitics can only laugh at the problem-solution model, captive - and instrumental - as it is to the very forces that produce such monsters. Like wars on poverty, drugs and terror, our \"problems\" are at best misnamed and botched - at worst, maliciously instrumentalized.
  <br><br>

  Against the closed system and political economy of the isolated problem, Mangroves reconceives complex and large-scale challenges in terms of <i>periblems</i>. Arising organically from our basal thought-vehicle of (inter)affectivity, the periblem (< Gk. <i>peri</i>, around + <i>ballo</i>, cast/throw) presupposes an immanent dynamic and ecology of unbounded interaffections (affecting/being affected), immersive to human and other subjectivities. We are always inside the periblem, part and constitutive of it. There is no one vantage point to measure its whole. They are all multilateral, vectoral, and highly networked conditionings of reality and life. But just as the conditioning and actancy in a periblem are many-sided and therefore to be construed beyond anthropic framings - starting from the question of \"need,\" so is the possible addressing/inflecting of it. Periblems cannot be fixed or mended, much less by one human or group alone; they do not go away, but only evolve and develop differentially. We can only find ways to invite and enable from within the coactancy across identities, species, categories. In working through and inflecting periblems from their sublime interior, we begin to see \"problems\" cede to new possibilities and framings of experience and action, which offers the potential of new arcs and mutations of reality.
  <br><br>

  This evolutionary pragmatics of the periblem is the <i>modus operandi</i> of Mangroves as a collaboratory, whose very emergence is an unrestricted call to collaboration across all that affect, constitute life. It is a desire to recondition possibilities that drives and informs our work of deep design.
