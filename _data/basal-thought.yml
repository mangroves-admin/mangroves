name: BasalThought
copy: "Weber's Freischütz Overture. The conductor: a rakish Carlos Kleiber. He starts the orchestra on a pp - stops it right away. No so forward, he tells his men. \"Come in after everybody else.\" Nonsense - but it works exactly as he intends, uncannily emergent: e nihilo omnia.

It's this utterly emergent contingency of things that piques - and illuminates - our basal thought (what used to be called metaphysics, as if an afterthought, can also be termed protophysics). This thinking is both a navigational vessel and its own flight. It is itself emerging and contingent, and can be self-navigated in a Möbius way. Reality can be summed up thus: Affect affects affect, where the noun verbalizes its own becoming. Affect < affectus, singular and plural. Being(s), knowing, happening, any change or constancy, are all affect; so are energy, matter, their antitheses, information, ∆, spacetime. Affect = affecting and being affected - at whatever scale or intensity, in whatever direction(s) or framing. Everything is a differential, metabolic play of affect through the virtual, actual, hidden/absent...

Of consequence, systems are illusionments, affects playing together. So are events, ages, and processes, including growth, decay, creating, moving. They can achieve visibility or consistence or not - itself be an affect. Everything can be dis/affected, thus also dis/illusioned, but that is not the end of affect - only its reaffecting.
<br><br>
 
History, at any scale - cosmic, geologic, civilizational/epochal, what occurs in a day, are illusionments, as are their Zeitgeiste, material sub- or superstructures. We, as singular-plural affects, live in perpetual dis/illusionment, and can affect (change or make up) things (affects) in relation to all other affectivity. So can all other affects. It's the grand commeatus (trafficking) that is throbbing reality.
