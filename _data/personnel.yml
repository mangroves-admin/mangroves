  bio: "was trained in several disciplines, periods and traditions in the US, Japan, Italy, and Israel. As a post-academic polyglot thinker, he plies coworking across boundaries and experiences amidst the mega circus of more-than-human life. Skeptical of the ubiquitous imperative of \"problem solving,\" he started this collaboratory to abet thinking and lifeways not centered on human \"profit,\" but humbly nested in sublime webs of life."

  bio: "is a recent graduate of Bard College with a thesis joining material semiotics, story, and the historical narratives of some defining materials of modernity (plastic, wood, and cement). She is deeply invested in how creativity opens people up to the ecologic dance within and around them, and sees Mangroves as a force to enhance such vibrations through its yearly Fellowship and upcoming projects."
