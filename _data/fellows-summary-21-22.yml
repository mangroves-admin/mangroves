- title: "2021-22: The Common and the Commonable"
  copy: "Mangroves launched its Pilot Fellowship with the theme \"the Common and the Commonable.\" The notion of the common might at first recall something mundane, resourceable, exploitable - or public. The commonable might evoke rocky grass fields or animals grazing with bent necks on sharable land. Both might be reduced to some objectified commons. Our path, however, was to expand from this legacy of the common and commonable, asking what they might signify when freed from such contexts.
  <br><br>


  Our fearless cohort unwound these terms by imagining the common as any webbing of encounters: dealings of any kind between forms or processes, between worldviews and ideologies, between stories and methodologies. The common, in this context, is as manifest in the gut biome of a cow as it is in a room of political negotiation, in caves, around creek and the rock, as it is in spirit. Here, too, we faced our first quandary: where the common ends and the uncommon begins. 
  <br><br>

  It became necessary to sniff out where the common has faced erasure due to hierarchical designations, particularly those pitting knowledges and worldings against each other in such a way that the uncommon emerges a violent force. In turn, the common can also become a force of erasure, mushing difference into a purée of the \"universal.\" 
  <br><br>

  At one scale, the Fellows approached this by looking to Arturo Escobar's weaving of the \"pluriverse\" as an alternative framing of knowledge to the tyrannical centrifuge of global development. As Mangrovians went on from Escobar's own flight from the universal, they began to seek not only the cohabitation of multiform truths and lifeways, but also how they can dance with each other - and allow traversal between them. We read origin stories from around the world, asking what is common and uncommon between them, and how those dis/junctions are born of the ecological commons such stories poke out of. 
  <br><br>

  Keeping the tension taut between the common and commonable, the cohort swung through disciplines and scales, feeling our shared ideas morph and even become unrecognizable. We looked to American cities and the work of Jane Jacobs, to the uncommon in our own spirits in Gloria Anzaldua's writing, to biodiversity and human positions in it, and to religion, art, and ideas of the good life. Without reaching explicit end points or points of production, the Fellowship slowly and surely became a practice of making a common in itself. Each Fellow, with peculiar perspectives informed by history, legacy, place, and self, met the others in uncommon commonness, practicing the art of mutual creation, agreement, disagreement, and listening. This became a touchstone to imagining other uncommon commons - even beyond human worldings.

  In the second half of the year, we were lucky to welcome guest discussants on community fisheries (C Klein), migration (R Bendezú), bioconservation (S Pimm), Islamicate Cosmopolitanism (B Lawrence), arcology (L McCullough), and to honor the specific skills brought by Fellows through the co-creation of our curriculum and the release of central leadership. This led us to points we couldn't have conceived at the start of the year, including musical exercises held over Zoom, musings over broken rules and physics, multilinguistic exercises, and continually emergent and unexpected writing. Our focus gradually shifted to the question of how Fellows might seed the co-generation and cultivation of commoning practices tailored to local contexts, where the players already extend beyond humans. In the end, we both hoped for the Fellows to keep exploring such a process beyond their year together, and to continue the year's work in future cohorts and projects with the inklings gained thus far."
