- title: Basal Thought
  copy: "Truly radical doing seethes with radical thought, and that thought speaks a new tongue. This may take calm patience to digest. At Mangroves we think and do <i>interaffectivity</i>: the ceaseless swirl of <i>affecting</i> and <i>being affected</i> through diverse relations, scales and worldings. This goes beyond interdependence or interbeing. Things-relations-happenings are not independent or self-subsistent but they are always metabolic, thanks to the sheer contingency of the real."

- title: Problem vs. Periblem
  copy: "Since this <i>interaffecting</i> goes on everywhere, no issue is self-contained. The traditional problem-solution model is at best an easy fiction, at worst (and certain scales) a crippling mirage. We chase after problems as if things volumetric to be batted under control, when they always outrun us and, together with their solutions, spawn new \"problems\" left unthought. So instead of the \"problem,\" we think the <i>periblem</i>: reality as ever immersive and porous all around. In place of solutions, we spur <i>inflections</i> that play with the giddy thickness of reality from/in many directions. This transgresses a merely human optic, much less a commercial or statist frame. So, we don't <i>solve</i> anything (so as to walk away from it), because the periblem never closes or stops but keeps on churning."

- title: Deep Counterdesign
  copy: "With a <i>periblematic</i> approach, we start rethinking how to engage the vast - and deeply tied - waves of life earthwide. We burrow at what's already been in the long flex of time, even prehuman and pre-Earth, and what is likely to come, while traversing varying worldings. Then we (help) forge a theoretical framing fit to matters at hand. Amidst these deep, roaming views, we find the spinning particularities of any locale/theater where certain (meta)praxes may be seeded, prototyped, grown. Throughout, we embrace distinct cultural and geobiotic factors to respect conditions on the ground, so as to urge a synergy of local forces for common life, in turn spurring other tailored interventions translocally. In this sense we are also after a <i>sharable</i> - not imposed - <i>common</i>."
