  copy: "To do the longterm work we propose, we'll need robust funding. In staging strong Fellowship work, we will offer generous stipends; conduct retreats and field trips; and give seed money for subsequent work. Similarly, our staff work requires unstinting support. The best way to enable our mission is to build a perduring endowment to underwrite our budget. This is for us to keep focused on advancing Deep Counter Design. We call this strategy \"stealth scaling\": fast and sure, yet respecting limit. In the spirit of Mangroves' work, we intend to invest by work and silver in undertakings that irradiate social good: B Corps, worker cooperatives, ESG integration or DEI policies, with special attention to indigenous and other disadvantaged communities. In adopting these considerations, however, we will also look past labels and glib rhetoric, and do our best to assess actual good. We will publish our Annual Reports so you can see how your gifts to us are put to work, both in investment and use. We are currently seeking a Fiscal Sponsor. When one is secured, we'll be able to solicit and receive funds. If you have no money to give, but would like to share in other ways, do let us know: <a href=\"mailto:tidings@mangroves.life\">tidings@mangroves.life</a>. Either way, we will be happy to hear from you."
