copy: "\"Design nothing!\" screamed Enzo Mari, the Italian maker who insisted on access for all to the production of useful forms. Implicit in his call is a firm commitment to equity across classes at a time when sleek mid-century design was also projecting an elitist privilege. In the vice grip twixt the homogenization and hyper-niching of Late Capital, we face the same trap still: Design something sophisticated for higher-end consumption, or dispense with user agency altogether. As to wellbeing, it's either an act of insulation or abandonment to mass callous blight.
<br><br>

Mangroves rejects this dichotomy. In displacing the problem-solution <i>habitus</i> of our age with an <i>inflective periblematics</i>, we will enlist deep study and thought, stepping into the length and breadth of things - water, movement, conflict or whatever, around their current patterns, and through many tellings and eyes. Out of such variegation may we discern threads of commonality, intersection or overlap, not to say uncommonable specificities. In this way, history and theory shall dance with data and speculation, facts with intuition, and critique with creation. It is in such a staging of things that <i>happy mutation</i> may emerge.
<br><br>

From what would such mutation diverge? It would thread a path out of the overwhelming violence and inertia of the technosphere, that juggernaut of growth and accumulation at the cost of all, where even extreme prerogative and power are deceived. Agency would no longer stagnate at the apices of the money/power matrix but see exertion unchained and a-teeming. In beginning to descaffold the conjuncture of neoliberal hyper-accumulation and ecological collapse - indeed deinvent \"resource,\" this new design, as hale descriptive rather than prescriptive, would also begin to decenter humans from the driving train of planetary becoming. Sovereignty would be withdrawn from a few mega points to be tended across the nexus of the deep ecological horizon.
<br><br>

This morphs the process called design into one in which the center <i>can</i> be anywhere, and circumference nowhere. In practice, it will invite and engage more-than-human communities in translocal networks from the ground up, soil to sky. The design would interlace <i>coactancy</i> wherever thinkable and embed itself with the awareness that the process would evolve with successive modulations in response to emergent needs and conditions.
