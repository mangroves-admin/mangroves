- title: Pilot Fellowship
  copy: "From October 2021 to May 2022, we held our pilot fellowship in hybrid format. With twelve around a table or joining from Uganda to Utah (and Italy, Canada in between), we worked once a week on the theme of \"the common and the commonable.\" Starting with a multilingual/cultural approach and leaving behind \"resources\" as the grounding of any common, we explored what it would mean to bring the whole interactive web of coactants into the mix, far beyond the conventional anthropocentric way. Along the way, explored notions of care, festivity, pluriverse, \"transverse,\" <i>buen vivir</i>, GNHI, (re)migration, the biotic, placemaking, <i>arcology</i>, habitat, and Mangroves' own ideas of affectivity, periblem and counterdesign, with which our collaboratory will be seeding projects in time to come."

- title: Carless Rome
  copy: "With Rome our future home as our live laboratory, we are studying a plan by Eng. Antonio Tamburrino to transmobilize the Eternal City. Long the site of comprehensive transport, Rome has also fallen to the chokehold of automobiles and mass tourism, with all attendant degradation in ecological, economic and cultural conditions. This plan seeks to <i>revive</i> and <i>recondition</i> the city by unclogging mobility throughout, removing cars from the historic city, and connecting all parts largely through free electric people-movers. The time and space liberated can then afford new forms of life, work, habitat-building for a rich lifeweb. How viable is this plan? Follow us as we learn and think more!"

- title: Connival on Growth
  copy: "In 1972, the Club of Rome issued <i>The Limits to Growth</i>, a report on the state of the planet that sounded alarm about the viability of the global economy. Thirty years later, it was revised to advocate <i>degrowth</i>. Half a century later, we intend not only to review this trajectory of thought and its impact in light of current realities, but indeed to reinterrogate the very concept of growth. We will do this next year in Rome with a conference-carnival - hence <i>connival</i>, moving around the city with thinking, doing, and moving out of the econometric prison of growth. All are welcome in person or online, and a documentary will also ensue."
