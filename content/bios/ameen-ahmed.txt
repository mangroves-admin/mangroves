Ameen Ahmed is a curator, artist, writer, and researcher from Bangalore, India, and
Toronto, Canada. His current research interests revolve around “magic”, which he
describes as the use of the rhetoric and methods of religion and myth by political and
corporate agents of “progress” and “development”. This is part of a larger interest in
stories and storytelling, whether those stories are disseminated through media, or
through visual, political, or architectural means.
