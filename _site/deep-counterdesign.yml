name: DeepCounterdesign
copy: "\"Design nothing!\" screamed Enzo Mari, the Italian maker who insisted on access for all to the production of useful forms. Implicit in his call is a firm commitment to equity across classes at a time when sleek mid-century design was also projecting an elitist privilege. In the vice grip twixt the homogenization and hyper-niching of Late Capital, we face the same trap still: Design something sophisticated for higher-end consumption, or dispense with user agency altogether. As to wellbeing, it's either an act of insulation or abandonment to mass callous blight.

Mangroves rejects this dichotomy. In displacing the problem-solution habitus of our age with an inflective periblematics, we must enlist deep study and thought, stepping into the length and breadth of things - water, movement, conflict - whatever, around their current patterns, and through many tellings and eyes. Out of such variegation might we discern threads of commonality, intersection or overlap, not to say uncommonable specificities. Thus will history and theory dance with data and speculation, facts with intuition, critique with creation. It is in such a staging of things that happy mutation may emerge.

From what would such mutation diverge? It would needle a path out of the overwhelming violence and inertia of the technosphere, an engine of growth and accumulation at the cost of all, where even extreme prerogative is deceived - even wielding iron scepters of force. Agency would no longer stagnate at the apices of the money/power matrix but see exertion a-teeming. In beginning to descaffold the conjuncture of neoliberal hyper-accumulation and ecological collapse - indeed deinvent \"resource,\" this new design as hale descriptive rather than prescriptive would also begin to decenter humans from the driving train of planetary becoming. Sovereignty would be withdrawn from single points and splattered across the nexus of the deep ecological horizon.
<br><br>

This morphs the process called design into one in which the center can be anywhere, circumference nowhere. In practice it will invite and engage more-than-human communities in locales and networks from the bottom up, soil to sky. The design would interlace coactancy wherever thinkable and, while countervailing trends of inertial violence, embed itself with the awareness that the process would evolve with successive modulations or breaks in response to emergent needs and conditions.
