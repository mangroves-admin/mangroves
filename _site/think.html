                    <p>Truly radical praxis embodies radical thought, and that thought speaks a new tongue. This may take some patience to learn. At Mangroves we think and do <i>interaffectivity</i>: reality as a constant swirl of <i>affecting and being affected</i> through diverse relations, scales and worldings. This goes beyond interdependence or interbeing. Nothing is independent or self-subsistent but at most metastable thanks to a contingent pattern of interaffectivity, which is before, during and virtual to any reality.</p>

                <div class="think-info">
                    <p>Since this <i>interaffecting</i> goes on everywhere, no issue is self-contained. This means the traditional problem-solution model is at best a convenient fiction, at worst (at large scales) a crippling illusion. We chase after problems as if volumetric objects to be wrestled under control, when they always outrun us and even spawn new "problems" left unthought. So instead of the "problem," Mangroves thinks the <i>periblem</i>: reality as ever immersive and porous all around. Instead of solutions, we advocate <i>inflections</i> that play with the complex richness of reality from many directions. This should go beyond a merely human perspective much less a narrowly commercial or statist view. But we don't <i>solve</i> anything so as to walk away from it, because the periblem as reality never closes or stops but keeps evolving.</p>

                    <p>With a periblematic approach, we embark on rethinking how to engage the great - and deeply interconnected - exigencies of planetary life. To do so we must first have an idea of what already has been in the long span of history - even prehuman and pre-Earth, and what is likely to come. Equally important is a theoretical framing that does justice to what is being engaged. Into these deep perspectives are emplaced the particularities of any locale where any praxis may be seeded, prototyped. We are mindful to include cultural and geobiotic factors to honor conditions on the ground, so as to stage a synergy of local forces for common life in turn spurring other tailored interventions. In this sense we are also after a <i>sharable</i> - but not imposed - <i>common</i>.</p>
