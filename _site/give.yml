  copy: "Many thanks for considering! We are a nonprofit registered and now operating in North Carolina, USA, aspiring one day to be headquartered in Rome, the persistent crossroads from all directions. We are at present under review for the 501(3)(c) tax exemption status with the US Internal Revenue Service. Once we obtain the Letter of Determination (approval) from the IRS, we will be able to receive financial gifts tax-free directly. Till then, you are welcome to donate any amount through our Fiscal Sponsor."
